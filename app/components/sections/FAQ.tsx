  {
    question: "What is the roadmap for VoiceTypr?",
    answer: "We keep VoiceTypr purposely minimal so it always feels fast and reliable. Instead of chasing an endless list of features, we focus on perfecting speech-to-text dictation and shipping ongoing bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements."
