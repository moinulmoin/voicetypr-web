- **Secondary:** Writers, developers with RSI, ADHD productivity seekers
- **Positioning:** "Ship 3x faster with voice - for people whose thoughts move faster than their fingers"

## üí∞ Competitive Positioning

### Direct Competitors
| Competitor | Pricing | Weakness | Our Attack |
|------------|---------|----------|------------|
| **SuperWhisper** | $8.49/mo ($102/yr) | Subscription model | "Why pay $102/year when you can pay $19 once?" |
| **Wispr Flow** | $15/mo ($180/yr) | VC-backed, expensive | "Built by developers, not VCs" |
| **Willow Voice** | $15/mo ($180/yr) | YC pressure, subscription | "YC-quality product, indie pricing" |
| **Dragon** | $500 one-time | Expensive, bloated | "1/25th the price, works offline" |

## üöÄ Launch Strategies

### Reddit Strategy

#### Week 1 Schedule

| Tue | r/macapps | "Native Mac dictation app that actually understands code syntax [Free Trial]" | 9 AM EST |

# Price Question Response
It's $19 lifetime right now (early bird). We're bootstrapped, not VC-funded, 
so we can actually offer sustainable pricing instead of the usual $15/mo subscription.

# Competitor Mention Response
Yeah, [competitor] is solid! Main differences: we're one-time purchase vs 
their subscription, and everything runs locally on your machine. Plus we have 
[specific feature]. Happy to answer any questions!
